# Absen Online
My plan in making this application is to make it easier for user to fill in attendance. The application that I will make is an android apk project, I apply several functions such as geolocation to this application so that user do not commit fraud in maintaining the policies that we have made.

>I like to make something that can inspire you, maybe it's an advantage that God gave, but besides that I also need food to continue my life, I'm very grateful for all the blessings that God has given, and thank you for those of you who have helped me.
